 <body>
 
	<p><u>Last Updated: Feb 29, 2016</u></p>
	<p>Spootr Privacy Policy (this "Policy") explains what personal information Spootr ("our," or "we") collects from users of our service, mobile applications, website at spootr.com. How we use and disclose it. By using our Application, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
	<p>Through the Application, you can anonymously share contents in a specific Virtual Community called "Circle" that would be a physical community in your area. When you share a Post through the app, other members of that "Circle” can put “Emotions" and "Comments" on your post. On the other hand, the "Comments" by you and the other users of the "Circle" will not be semi-anonymous depending on your account. In addition, only the members of chosen "Circle" will be able to see your posts.</p>
	
		<b>Modifications</b>
			<p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, provide you with additional notice (sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the privacy policy periodically to stay informed about our practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>

		<b>Collection of Information</b>
			<b>Personal Information</b>
			<p>"Personal Information" as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.

			<p>Personal Information does not include "aggregate" or other non-personally identifiable information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed. We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.</p>
